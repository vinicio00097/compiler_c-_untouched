C++ Compiler Project
====================

This is just a project to exercise the concepts and theory of compilers. As you might guess, this is a C++ compiler and it will be built using JFlex and Cup.
Because we don't have access to the official C++ Standard, we decided to follow
this [specifiation](http://www.nongnu.org/hcb/).

## Tools ##
### JFlex 1.5###

JFlex is a scanner generator. JFlex reads a lexical specification and outputs java sources for the generated scanner. If you don't have experience with JFlex, access the [official website](http://jflex.de/) and try it! See the ```README``` file for more information and examples.

### CUP 11a ###
CUP is a LALR (lookahead-LR method) parser generator. CUP reads a syntacitc specification and outputs the java sources for the generated parser. If you dont't have experience with CUP, access the [manual](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/manual.html#intro) for more information.

## Building the Project ##

* First, make sure you have [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) installed in your computer.
* By this moment, you just need to run ```ant``` on the project's root directory.

## Extending the Grammar ##

The Lexical and Syntax Analyzers **must** be extended together.
It is **extremely** important to follow these guidelines:

* After modifying ```lexical.flex``` and/or ```parser.cup```, run ```ant compile```.
* Resolve Warnings before pushing (or create a remote branch for fixing and open an issue in the repository).
* Implement grammar rules one by one.
* Add ```NOT IMPLEMENTED``` on rules not implemented.
